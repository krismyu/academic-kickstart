I am a linguist and a phonetician and phonologist. My primary focus is prosody from the speech signal to grammar and processing. My work integrates diverse approaches, including fieldwork, experiments, formal language theory, and machine learning. Recent language areas of focus include Samoan, Formosan languages, and African American English.
