abstract: "This paper explores variability in the fundamental frequency (f0) of utterances containing the remote past marker BIN in African American English, which has been described as having higher f0, intensity and duration relative to preceding material, and reduced f0 following, though with some interspeaker variability (Green et al. 2022). Here we re-analyze data from Green et al. (2022) to characterize the space of possible phonetic realizations of BIN utterances. We computed the 90th percentile f0 value in pre-/on-/post-BIN regions to create a 3-point \'topline\' f0 shape profile of the utterance (Cooper & Sorensen 1981) and performed time series clustering and principal components analysis (PCA). Two clusters were identified, one with higher f0 on BIN and lower f0 post-BIN, and one with lower f0 on BIN and higher f0 post-BIN. Results from PCA indicate speakers vary along two dimensions: one relating to pre-BIN f0 and one to post-BIN f0. Both dimensions were tied to f0 height on BIN, demonstrating the role that global aspects of the contour play in the variability. We show how the topline representation of f0 contour shape is robust to missing values and uncontrolled sentences and thus useful for naturalistic speech."
