title: "Unbounded recursion in two dimensions, where syntax and
prosody meet"
subtitle: ""
authors: ['stabler','admin']
publication_types: ["2"]
publication: "*Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics*"
publication_short: "*SCIL*"
abstract: "Both syntax and prosody seem to require structures with unbounded
branching, something that is not immediately provided by multiple
context free grammars or other equivalently expressive formalisms.
That extension is easy, and does not disrupt an
appealing model of prosody/syntax interaction.  Rather than
computing prosodic and syntactic structures independently and then
selecting optimally corresponding pairs, prosodic structures can be
computed directly from the syntax, eliminating alignment issues and
the need for bracket-insertion or other ad hoc devices.  To
illustrate, a simple model of prosodically-defined Irish pronoun
extraposition is briefly compared to previous proposals."
